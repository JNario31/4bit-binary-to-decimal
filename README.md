# 4bit-binary-to-decimal
Uses FPGA De-10 Lite 7-segment display to show conversion of binary to decimal of 4-bit patterns
Stack: Intel Quartus, Verilog HDL

Uses SW3 (MSB), SW2, SW1, SW0 (LSB) as the four inputs: a,b,c,d
depending on the input pattern it will assign a 7-bit pattern to
segments and display the corresponding decimal representation on the 
display
